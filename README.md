## ✨ Key Agents

Rent-Swarm is composed of specialized AI agents working in concert:

- **🕵️ The Scout**: An autonomous scraper that finds listings (Craigslist integrated), extracts hidden data (like image IDs), and assigns a "Scam Score" and "True Cost" estimate.
- **⚖️ The Lawyer**: A RAG-powered legal analyst. Upload a PDF lease, and it flags risky clauses, illegal terms, and red flags based on local jurisdiction laws.
- **📈 The Forecaster**: Predictive analytics engine. Tells you if a unit is overpriced based on historical data and market trends.
- **💬 The Negotiator**: Generates professional, leverage-based negotiation emails. It uses data from the Scout and Forecaster to draft persuasive copy.
- **📂 Intelligence Dossier**: Summarizes all findings for a specific listing into a downloadable, classified-style PDF report.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router), React, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes, Server Actions
- **Database**: MongoDB (User Data, Bookmarks)
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js (Email/Password)
- **AI Logic**: Google Gemini 2.0 Flash (Reasoning), LangChain
